# Issues and Problems Faced During Automation

Author: Leonid Ksenchuk
Project: cPanel Store Automation (Playwright + TypeScript)

---

## 🐛 Issues Found

1. ❌ The "Continue" button occasionally fails to become clickable due to slow validation of the IP address.
   - Workaround: Added explicit waits and retry logic.
   - Consider using `await page.waitForLoadState()` or similar on real projects.

2. ❌ Addon checkbox was styled with a non-native UI (`iCheck`), which made it hard to trigger via standard selectors.
   - Workaround: Clicked the visible parent label or styled box.

3. ❌ Duplicate test title error when writing multiple test cases under same description.
   - Fixed by giving each test a unique title.

4. ⚠️ ESlint initially failed due to config format (v9 uses `eslint.config.mjs`)
   - Migrated from `.eslintrc.json` to `.mjs` format.
   - Installed all necessary plugins manually.

## 🧪 Skipped Tests

_No tests skipped. All core flow tests passed locally._

## ⏱ CI Note

Tests pass locally, but CI performance may vary based on site responsiveness (as it’s a live store). Recommend running with `--headed` for visibility if debugging.

---

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement

- cPanel Store could benefit from test IDs on dynamic elements.
- Use of styled checkboxes makes test automation harder and less reliable.
- Prorated pricing introduces complexity in test validation — may need to mock/freeze date for full accuracy.
